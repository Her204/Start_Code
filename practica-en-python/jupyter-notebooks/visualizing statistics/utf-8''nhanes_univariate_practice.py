# # Practice notebook for univariate analysis using NHANES data
# 
# This notebook will give you the opportunity to perform some univariate analyses on your own using the NHANES.  These analyses are similar to what was done in the week 2 NHANES case study notebook.
# 
# You can enter your code into the cells that say "enter your code here", and you can type responses to the questions into the cells that say "Type Markdown and Latex".
# 
# Note that most of the code that you will need to write below is very similar to code that appears in the case study notebook.  You will need to edit code from that notebook in small ways to adapt it to the prompts below.
# 
# To get started, we will use the same module imports and read the data in the same way as we did in the case study:

# Relabel the marital status variable [DMDMARTL](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/DEMO_I.htm#DMDMARTL) to have brief but informative character labels.  Then construct a frequency table of these values for all people, then for women only, and for men only.  Then construct these three frequency tables using only people whose age is between 30 and 40.

#There are more women than men married between the ages of 30 and 40. (285 and 275 respectively).
# __Q1c.__ Repeat part b for the men.
#Married 275, Never Married 101, Living with partner 78, Divorced 24, Separeted 12, Widowed 3 and Refused 1.
# ## Question 2
# 
# Restricting to the female population, stratify the subjects into age bands no wider than ten years, and construct the distribution of marital status within each age band.  Within each age band, present the distribution in terms of proportions that must sum to 1.
